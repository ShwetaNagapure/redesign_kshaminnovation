      <!-- Description of Ksham Innovation's mission -->
      <p>At Ksham Innovation, we break down barriers and make technology accessible to everyone. We believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to hear, speak, and navigate the world in real-time, regardless of having hearing, speech, or visual impairment.
        <br> Our technology is designed to empower those with disabilities, allowing them to learn, communicate & perform their daily chores with greater ease and independence. But our work doesn't stop there. We dream & envision creating a smart and safer alternative to traditional earbuds and headphones, extending the age during which people may face difficulties in hearing.
        <br>By doing so, we are not only improving the lives of those with hearing loss, but also providing a solution for anyone who wants to enjoy music, information access in a safer way, and audio content while minimizing the risk of damaging their hearing.</p>
